## Overview

**El Silbón** (The Whistler) is a vengeful ghost from the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos (plains). He appears as a **tall, gaunt man** who carries a heavy bag containing **his father's bones**. The ghost is cursed to wander forever, whistling a distinctive **ascending note pattern** (do-re-mi).

His most distinctive and dangerous feature is **sound reversal**: when his whistling sounds close, he is actually far away, but when it sounds distant, he is dangerously near.

El Silbón's origin involves **patricide**—he killed his father and was cursed to carry the bones forever. He hunts specific victims: **drunkards and unfaithful men**, killing them and adding their bones to his bag. Each night he counts the bones.

**Dogs** can sense his presence and their howling/barking warns people. He fears barking dogs, making them the primary protection. This is a **cautionary tale** warning against alcoholism, infidelity, and disrespecting parents.
