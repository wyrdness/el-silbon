      "full": "El Silbón (The Whistler) is a vengeful ghost from the Venezuelan and Colombian llanos (plains). He appears as a tall, gaunt man who carries a heavy bag containing his father's bones. The ghost is cursed to wander forever, whistling a distinctive ascending note pattern (do-re-mi). His most distinctive feature is sound reversal: when his whistling sounds close, he is actually far away, but when it sounds distant, he is dangerously near. El Silbón's origin story involves patricide—he killed his father (various versions: because father killed mother, or after eating deer innards he shouldn't have) and was cursed to carry the bones forever. He hunts specific victims: drunkards and unfaithful men, killing them and adding their bones to his bag. Each night he counts the bones. Dogs can sense his presence and their howling/barking warns people. Protection includes dogs (he fears them) and chili pepper. This is a cautionary tale warning against alcoholism, infidelity, and disrespecting parents. The legend remains active in Venezuelan and Colombian plains regions."
